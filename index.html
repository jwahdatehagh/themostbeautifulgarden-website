                  You gathered plants from every region of the world.  <br>
                  Now, the time has come for you to plant every single flower you have brought with you.  <br>
                  Let every flower, every leaf have its place. Arrange a most beautiful and unique garden, open and accessible to everyone who would like to see and experience it and understand its message!"</em></p>
